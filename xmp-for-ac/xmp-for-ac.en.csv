CreateDate:rdfs_comment,Comment for Original Date and Time http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/CreateDate,"The date and time the resource was created. For a digital file, this need not match a file-system creation time.  For a freshly created resource, it should be close to that time, modulo the time taken to write the file.  Later file transfer, copying, and so on, can make the file-system time arbitrarily different."
CreateDate:dcterms_description,Description for Original Date and Time http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/CreateDate,"What constitutes ""original"" is determined by the metadata author. Example: Digitization of a photographic slide of a map would normally give the date at which the map was created; however a photographic work of art including the same map as its content may give the date of the original photographic exposure. Imprecise or unknown dates can be represented as ISO dates or ranges. Compare also Date and Time Digitized in the Resource Creation Vocabulary. See also the wikipedia IS0 8601 entry, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601, for further explanation and examples."
