identificationQualifier:dcterms_description,Description for Identification Qualifier http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/identificationQualifier,"Splitting identification qualification and Scientific Taxon Name into separate fields is recommended practice in cases where only a single taxon name is available, or if the exchange format is able to keep relations between multiple names and identification qualifiers. Where the exchange format only supports simple multiplicities, a media item with multiple Scientific Taxon Names, some with, some without identification qualifiers, may have to be transferred with ""cf."" or ""aff."" qualifiers remaining embedded in the Scientific Taxon Name. Example: For the determinations ""cf. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. palmarum"", ""Fusarium cf. oxysporum f. sp. palmarum"", ""Fusarium oxysporum cf. f. sp. palmarum"" the Scientific Taxon Name would always be ""Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. palmarum"", with Identification Qualifier ""cf. genus"", ""cf. species"" and ""cf. f.sp."", respectively.
