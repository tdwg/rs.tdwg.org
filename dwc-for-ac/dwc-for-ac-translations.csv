Example: For the determinations ""cf. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. palmarum"", ""Fusarium cf. oxysporum f. sp. palmarum"", ""Fusarium oxysporum cf. f. sp. palmarum"" the Scientific Taxon Name would always be ""Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. palmarum"", with Identification Qualifier ""cf. genus"", ""cf. species"" and ""cf. f.sp."", respectively.

It is recommended to provide author citation to scientific names, to avoid ambiguities in the presence of homonyms (the same name created by different authors for different taxa).
