The ABCD Schema attempts to be comprehensive and highly structured, supporting data from a wide variety of databases. It is compatible with several existing data standards. Parallel structures exist so that either (or both) atomised data and free-text can be accommodated. Versions 1.2 and 2.06 are currently in use with the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility, http://www.gbif.org/ ) and  BioCASe (Biological Collection Access Service for Europe, http://www.biocase.org/ ) networks. Apart from the GBIF and BioCASe networks, the potential for the application of ABCD extends to internal networks, or in-house legacy data access (e.g. datasets from external sources that shall not be converted and integrated into an institution's own data, but be kept separately, though easily accessible). By defining relations between terms, ABCD is a step towards an ontology for biological collections.",2005-09-16,2005-09-16,Current (2005) standard,Technical specification,Access to Biological Collections Data Task Group. 2005.

2018-04-24T22:08:00-05:00,http://www.tdwg.org/standards/116,,Structured Descriptive Data (SDD),"In taxonomy, descriptive data takes a number of very different forms. Natural-language descriptions are semi-structured, semi-formalised descriptions of a taxon (or occasionally of an individual specimen). They may be simple, short and written in plain language (if used for a popular field guide), or long, highly formal and using specialised terminology when used in a taxonomic monograph or other treatment. Dichotomous keys are specialised identification tools comprising fragments of descriptive data arranged in couplets forming a branching tree. Each fragment (lead) comprises a small (occasionally verbose) natural-language description. Raw data descriptions usually comprise repeated measurements of parts of individual specimens, and are the basis from which the more abstracted descriptions in natural language and coded descriptions are derived. Few taxonomists consistently record and archive their raw data in a standardised format. The goal of the SDD standard is to allow capture, transport, caching and archiving of descriptive data in all the forms shown above, using a platform- and application-independent, XML-based international standard. Such a standard is crucial to enabling lossless porting of data between existing and future software platforms including identification, data-mining and analysis tools, and federated databases.",2005-09-16,2005-09-16,Current (2005) standard,Technical specification,Structure of Descriptive Data Subgroup. 2005.

2018-04-24T22:08:00-05:00,http://www.tdwg.org/standards/107,,Description Language for Taxonomy (DELTA),"When taxonomic descriptions are prepared for input to computer programs, the form of the coding is usually dictated by the requirements of a particular program or set of programs. This restricts the type of data that can be represented, and the number of other programs that can use the data. Even when working with a particular program, it is frequently necessary to set up different versions of the same basic data, for example, when using restricted sets of taxa or characters to make special-purpose keys. The potential advantages of automation, especially in connexion with large groups, cannot be realized if the data have to be restructured by hand for every operation. The DELTA (DEscription Language for TAxonomy) system was developed to overcome these problems. It was designed primarily for easy use by people rather than for convenience in computer programming, and is versatile enough to replace the written description as the primary means of recording data. Consequently, it can be used as a shorthand method of recording data, even if computer processing of the data is not envisaged.",1986,1986,Current (2005) standard,Technical specification,"Dallwitz, M.

2018-04-24T22:08:00-05:00,http://www.tdwg.org/standards/110,,Herbarium Information Standards and Protocols for Interchange of Data (HISPID3),"The 'Herbarium Information Standards and Protocols for Interchange of Data' (HISPID) is a standard format for the interchange of electronic herbarium specimen information. HISPID has been developed by a committee of representatives from all major Australian herbaria. This interchange standard was first published in 1989, with a revised version published in 1993. HISPID3 is an accession-based interchange standard. Although many fields refer to attributes of the taxon they should be construed as applying to the specimen represented by the record, not to the taxon per se. The interchange of taxonomic, nomenclatural, bibliographic, typification, rare and endangered plant conservation, and other related information is not dealt with in this standard, unless it specifically refers to a particular accession (record). This data dictionary is concerned primarily with data interchange standards but has considerable relevance to database structure since the task of preparing interchange files is simplified if the data fields of the despatching and receiving databases match, as far as possible, the interchange standard. If differences do exist then, generally, it is easier to combine data fields than it is to dissect them in a reliable manner. Fields that are concatenated are frequently heterogeneous in their nature and many preclude the possibility of rearranging the data contained within such fields. The fields discussed in this data dictionary cover most of the herbarium and botanic gardens sphere of activity and have been arranged in groups of similar types of information. In many cases these groups may coincide with separate well-defined tables (or databases) of structurally similar records. The challenge for herbarium data managers is to decide whether the data are to be efficiently exchanged as discrete but related tables (databases) or as a larger single flat file that may have to be appropriately dismembered by the receiving institution. Some database packages are able to stack multiple values in a single field. This useful data structure complicates the interchange format and will not be used at this stage.",1996,1996,Prior standard,Technical specification,Observation and Specimen Records. 1996.

Standardisation of terms and a unified system to describe uses are of enormous benefit to gatherers of information, especially where exchanges of data sets are involved. The standard provides a system whereby uses of plants (in their cultural context) can be described, using standardised descriptors and terms, and attached to taxonomic data sets.

As with all standards, POSS aims to provide both a clear, unambiguous framework for information management, and at the same time provides a mechanism for information exchange.

2018-04-24T22:08:00-05:00,http://www.tdwg.org/standards/109,,World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions (WGSRPD),"In setting out to establish standards for data fields in botanical databases, the International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases for Plant Sciences (TDWG) identified at an early stage of its existence a need for an agreed system of geographical units at approximately ""country"" level and upwards for use in recording plant distributions. This would aim to provide a standard which different organisations maintaining databases could adopt so that they could compare and exchange data with each other without loss of information due to incompatible geographical boundaries. The present publication has resulted from the deliberations over a period of three years of a committee of both taxonomic and applied botanists set up to produce such a standard. The system offered covers the whole world and identifies units at four levels, firstly continental, secondly regional (or subcontinental), thirdly at what may be called ""Botanical Country"" level (which may often ignore purely political considerations), and fourthly at a slightly lower level called ""Basic Recording Units"" where political integrity is fully recognised. In many cases, where Botanical Countries have no complicating political factors, the units at Level-3 and Level-4 are identical. Very large countries, however, have been subdivided into more conveniently sized units according to constituent states or provinces. It is a fundamental principle that units at all levels are bounded either by political boundaries which appear on modern maps or by coast lines. Modern geographical information systems have not superseded the need for such a scheme. This publication provides an introduction to the system followed by an account of the rationale behind decisions and the problems that had to be considered in its design. The geographical standard itself is presented in five tables. A gazetteer is included which relates over 2100 geographical names to this system. Finally, the units recognised are shown in seventeen maps.",1992,1992,Prior standard,,TDWG World Geographic Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions Committee. 2001.

It is biased towards 'Conservation Type Data Fields', but incorporates a procedure allowing for additional data fields to be identified and exchanged between gardens. It is because of this flexibility that it is believed that the ITF2 will remain relevant to Botanic Gardens for a long time despite the rapid change in information system technology in recent years. BGCI (http://www.bgci.org/ ) was helped by international editorial committee, ran a number of International Workshops within the Botanic Garden Community and also consulted with internationally known horticultural Groups over the last 5 years produce this final draft of the International Transfer Format for Botanic Garden Records - Version 2 and it is hoped that others beyond the Botanic Garden Community will be able to make use of this publication. ITF2 was developed in close conjunction with HISPID3 (Herbarium Information Standards and Protocols for the Interchange of Data Version 3, http://www.tdwg.org/standards/110 ) and its progress has been closely monitored by the Centers of Plant Conservation (CPC) based in St Louis, Missouri, North American which is currently developing an data exchange format based on ITF2 but requiring additional fields unique to their network.
