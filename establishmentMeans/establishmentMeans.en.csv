e001:label,Label for native (indigenous) http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e001,native (indigenous)
e001:definition,Definition for native (indigenous) http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e001,A taxon occurring within its natural range.
e001:notes,Notes for native (indigenous) http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e001,"What is considered native to an area varies with the biogeographic history of an area and the local interpretation of what is a ""natural range""."
e002:label,Label for native: reintroduced http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e002,native: reintroduced
e002:definition,Definition for native: reintroduced http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e002,"A taxon re-established by direct introduction by humans into an area that was once part of its natural range, but from where it had become extinct."
e002:notes,Notes for native: reintroduced http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e002,Where a taxon has become extirpated from an area where it had naturally occurred it may be returned to that area deliberately with the intention of re-establishing it.
e003:label,"Label for introduced (alien, exotic, non-native, nonindigenous) http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e003","introduced (alien, exotic, non-native, nonindigenous)"
e003:definition,"Definition for introduced (alien, exotic, non-native, nonindigenous) http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e003",Establishment of a taxon by human agency into an area that is not part of its natural range.
e003:notes,"Notes for introduced (alien, exotic, non-native, nonindigenous) http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e003","Organisms can be introduced to novel areas and habitats by human activity, either on purpose or by accident. Humans can also inadvertently create corridors that break down natural barriers to dispersal and allow organisms to spread beyond their natural range."
e004:label,Label for introduced: assisted colonisation http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e004,introduced: assisted colonisation
e004:definition,Definition for introduced: assisted colonisation http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e004,Establishment of a taxon specifically with the intention of creating a self-sustaining wild population in an area that is not part of the taxon's natural range.
e004:notes,Notes for introduced: assisted colonisation http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e004,In the event of environmental change and habitat destruction a conservation option is to introduce a taxon into an area it did not naturally occur.
e005:label,Label for vagrant (casual) http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e005,vagrant (casual)
e005:definition,Definition for vagrant (casual) http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e005,The temporary occurrence of a taxon far outside its natural or migratory range.
e005:notes,Notes for vagrant (casual) http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e005,Natural events and human activity can disperse organisms unpredictably into places where they may stay or survive for a period.
e006:label,"Label for uncertain (unknown, cryptogenic) http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e006","uncertain (unknown, cryptogenic)"
e006:definition,"Definition for uncertain (unknown, cryptogenic) http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e006",The origin of the occurrence of the taxon in an area is obscure.
e006:notes,"Notes for uncertain (unknown, cryptogenic) http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e006",When there is a lack of fossil or historical evidence for the occurrence of a taxon in an area it can be impossible to know if the taxon is new to the area or native.
e007:label,Label for native: endemic http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e007,native: endemic
e007:definition,Definition for native: endemic http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e007,A taxon with a natural distribution restricted to a single geographical area.
e007:notes,Notes for native: endemic http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/e007,"The term endemic is a subcategory of native and relates to geography, such as ""areas of endemism"", bioregions, and sometimes administrative boundaries. While a native taxon can naturally occur in several geographical areas an endemic taxon only occurs in one. In Darwin Core terms this would mean, ""A dwc:Organism referred to is recognized as a member of a dwc:Taxon endemic to the dcterms:Location at the time of the dwc:Occurrence."""
