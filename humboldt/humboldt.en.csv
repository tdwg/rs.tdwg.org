taxonCompletenessReported:dcterms_description,Description for Taxon Completeness Reported http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/taxonCompletenessReported,"This term is meant to alert users that the inventory was conducted in such a way that all of the target taxa (the combination of eco:targetTaxonomicScope and eco:excludedTaxonomicScope) should have been detectable if they were present during the dwc:Event. This term can provide data users with a qualitative measure of how comprehensively an area has been surveyed, which assists in interpreting species populations, areas of occupancy, inferring species absences, etc. This term is only relevant if the dwc:Event used restricted search or open search methods. If taxonomic completeness was assessed, the methods used or an explanation of the basis of the completeness should be stated in eco:taxonCompletenessProtocols. Recommended best practice is to use controlled value strings from the controlled vocabulary designated for use with this term, listed at http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/doc/tcr/.
