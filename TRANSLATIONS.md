# rs.tdwg.org translations

We are using [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/darwin-core) to translate Darwin Core, Latimer Core and related terms into several languages.  Crowdin tracks when changes are made to the source text, and suggests identical or near-identical translations from other sources such as the GBIF.org website  (GBIF also use Crowdin).

**If you wish to contribute, you *must* do this using Crowdin â€” changes made directly in Git/GitHub will either be overwritten, or will interfere with the process used by Crowdin.**

The resulting translations are in files named `*-translations.csv`, for example for [degreeOfEstablishment](./degreeOfEstablishment/degreeOfEstablishment-translations.csv).

## Technical process

The process assumes the [TDWG Standards Metadata](https://rs.tdwg.org/) procedure has been followed, i.e. that CSV files containing definitions, comments, examples and so on are present in this repository, with the structure defined by this repository.  For example, the most important source file for the Degree of Establishment vocabulary is [degreeOfEstablishment.csv](./degreeOfEstablishment/degreeOfEstablishment.csv).

Two Git branches on this repository are used by the process, to avoid cluttering the master branch with intermediate work.

A branch "[translations](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/tree/translations)" stores source (English) files for translation, in a format suitable for Crowdin: one word or phrase per line, consistent column ordering and a stable identifier column ([example: degreeOfEstablishment.en.csv](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/blob/translations/degreeOfEstablishment/degreeOfEstablishment.en.csv)).  These files are generated by [this script](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/blob/translations/process/translations/build-translations.py), which can be updated to add additional standards for translation.

Crowdin is configured to read these "*.en.csv" files.  It commits changes to the second branch, "crowdin_translations", with one file per language, for example [degreeOfEstablishment.es.csv](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/blob/translations/degreeOfEstablishment/degreeOfEstablishment.es.csv)).

Changes to either branch are tracked by GBIF's [Jenkins server](https://builds.gbif.org/job/rs.tdwg.org-translations/) which runs [this script](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/blob/translations/process/translations/update-crowdin-files.sh).  It does the following:

1. Merges any new or updated translations from the "crowdin_translations" branch to the "translations" branch.

2. Merges any English changes from the "master" branch into the "translations" branch.

3. Updates the `*.en.csv` which are read by Crowdin, if the English terms or definitions have changes or additions.

4. Updates the `*-translations.csv` files on the "master" branch with any new or changed translations.
