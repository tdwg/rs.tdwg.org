'Unknown' is an acceptable value, but 'Public Domain' is not. In that case, omit or leave empty xmpRights:Owner, and put 'Public Domain' in the Copyright Statement (dc:rights). Note: Audubon Core guidelines on value format are less restrictive than is specified in the IPTC guidelines.","Some providers use dc:publisher for this purpose, but it seems doubtful that the publisher is by necessity the copyright owner. 'Public Domain' is not an appropriate value because it denotes something that is not under copyright. Except for 'Public Domain' resources, it is strongly urged that this field be supplied.",,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/Attribution,,,No,No
2020-01-27T15:24:25-06:00,UsageTerms,http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/rights/,,2020-01-27,,,,,License Terms,"A collection of text instructions on how a resource can be legally used, given in a variety of languages.","The license statement defining how resources might be used. Information on a collection applies to all contained objects unless the object has a different statement. Where different quality variants (e. g. different resolutions of images) are published under different licenses, the AC term ""Licensing Exception Statement"" supports variant-specific licenses. Note that the medium or low resolution levels of the same image might be available under open access licenses.","Example: ""Available under Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 license"". This also describes the commercial availability of items. Buying an identification tool or media resource is essentially the purchase of an individual license. Examples for such License statements: ""Available through bookstores"" for a commercially published CD, and ""Individual licenses available for purchase"" for a high-resolution image. In general, this term determines the default licensing for the media. License terms specific to variants or representations of the media resource (e.g., different resolutions) are dealt within the section on Service Access Point Vocabulary",,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/Attribution,,,No,No
