Owner:dcterms_description,Description for Copyright Owner http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Owner,"Some providers use dc:publisher for this purpose, but it seems doubtful that the publisher is by necessity the copyright owner. 'Public Domain' is not an appropriate value because it denotes something that is not under copyright. Except for 'Public Domain' resources, it is strongly urged that this field be supplied."
Owner:skos_scopeNote,Usage for Copyright Owner http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Owner,"A list of the names of the owners of the copyright. 'Unknown' is an acceptable value, but 'Public Domain' is not. In that case, omit or leave empty xmpRights:Owner, and put 'Public Domain' in the Copyright Statement (dc:rights). Note: Audiovisual Core guidelines on value format are less restrictive than is specified in the IPTC guidelines."
