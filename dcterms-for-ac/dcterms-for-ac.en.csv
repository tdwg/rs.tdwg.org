available:dcterms_description,Description for Date Available http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/available,"A use case is the harvesting of metadata published before the media are available, which are pending a formal publication elsewhere. One important example is the case of metadata that documents an occurrence, which metadata harvesters might exploit without use of the media.

description:rdfs_comment,Comment for Description http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/description,An account of the resource. 
description:dcterms_description,Description for Description http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/description,"This property optionally allows the presentation of detailed information and will in most cases be shown together with the resource title. If both a description and a caption are present in the metadata, a description is typically displayed instead of the resource, whereas a caption is displayed together with the resource. The description should aim to be a good proxy for the underlying media resource in cases where only text can be shown, whereas the caption may only make sense when shown together with the media. Thus, in HTML it would be appropriate to use dcterms:description values for alt attributes in img elements. Often only one of description or caption is present; choose the term most appropriate for your metadata. It is the role of implementers of an AC concrete representation (e.g., an XML Schema, an RDF representation, etc.) to decide and document how formatting advice will be represented in descriptions serialized according to such representations."

source:dcterms_description,Description for Published Source http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/source,"If the resource was digitized from a non-digital resource, or was also previously published in a digital or printed publication, this describes the original. If a string is required for this, use dc:source. Do not put generally ""related"" publications in here. A URI that can be resolved and dereferenced to provide a description of the source resource may also be used here. For example, ""http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/fsa1998021539/PP/"" is the address of a web page that provides a description the original negative of a famous picture by the photographer Dorothea Lange and so would be an appropriate value of dcterms:source. The term may be repeatable if a montage of images. Information about further provenance beyond the ultimate source should be put in the derivedFrom attribute.

If the resource is video or audio, it refers to the time span, if any, depicted by the resource.

title:label,Label for Title http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/title,Title
title:rdfs_comment,Comment for Title http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/title,A name given to the resource.
title:dcterms_description,Description for Title http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/title,"It is strongly suggested to provide a title. The title facilitates interactions with humans: e.g., it could be used as display text of hyperlinks or to provide a choice of images in a pick list. The title is therefore highly useful and an effort should be made to provide it where it is not already available. When the resource is a collection without an institutional or official name, but with a thematic content, a descriptive title, e. g. ""Urban Ants of New England,"" would be suitable. In individual media resources depicting taxa, the scientific name or names of taxa often form a good title. Common names in addition to or instead of scientific names are also acceptable. Indications of action or roles captured by the media resource, such as predatory acts, are desirable (""Rattlesnake eating deer mouse"", ""Pollinators of California Native Plants"")."
