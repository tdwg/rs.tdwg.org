For terms from other vocabularies either a precise URI SHOULD be used, or, as long as all unqualified terms in all vocabularies are unique, metadata SHOULD provide the source vocabularies using the Subject Category Vocabulary term. The value SHOULD be a string, whose text can also be in the form of a URL.  These guidelines on value format are less restrictive than is specified by the IPTC guidelines."

LocationCreated:dcterms_description,Description for Location Created http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/LocationCreated,"The distinction between the location shown and created is often irrelevant, and metadata may be assumed to be referring to location shown. It is recommended that the Location Shown field above always be used when known. However, in the case of position data automatically recorded by the instrument (e. g. EXIF GPS data) Location Created should be used to maintain information accuracy. When one but not both of these locations are present, AC is silent about whether the provided one entails the other.
