LocationCreated:dcterms_description,Description for Location Created http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/LocationCreated,"The distinction between the location shown and created is often irrelevant, and metadata may be assumed to be referring to location shown. It is recommended that the Location Shown field above always be used when known. However, in the case of position data automatically recorded by the instrument (e. g. EXIF GPS data) Location Created should be used to maintain information accuracy. When one but not both of these locations are present, AC is silent about whether the provided one entails the other. A best practices document for a particular AC implementation might address this."
