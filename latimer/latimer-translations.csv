Event,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/Event,Event,,,,,,,,,,An action that occurs at some location during some time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Derived from dwc Class event (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/version/Event-2018-09-06).

MeasurementOrFact,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/MeasurementOrFact,Measurement or Fact,,,,,,,,,,"A measurement of or fact about a class within the standard, or a relationship between the ObjectGroup and an associated class.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This class can be used to apply measurements, facts or narratives to the ObjectGroup as a whole, or used to qualify the relationship between the ObjectGroup and an associated attribute. For example, an ObjectGroup may contain 100 objects, of which 40 are from Europe and 60 from Africa. In this example, one MeasurementOrFact (count of 100) would be attached to the ObjectGroup, and one to each of the two relationships between the ObjectGroup and GeographicContext (Europe: count of 40, Africa: count of 60).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can be used to arrange these different units at different levels into a hierarchical structure. This class combines aspects of both class org:Organization (https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-vocab-org-20140116/#org:Organization) and class org:OrganizationalUnit (https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-vocab-org-20140116/#org:OrganizationalUnit) from the W3C Organization Ontology ORG (https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-vocab-org-20140116/#overview-of-ontology). Recommended best practice is to associate a unique, persistent organisational identifier (PID) with each created organisational unit. This will allow an unambiguous and continual identification of the unit, as well as the creation of organisational hierarchies. Existing providers of PIDs for organisations are, e.g. https://grid.ac/ and https://ror.org/. The provision of organisational PIDs might be extended to intra-organisational units in the future. Properties of Class: Identifier can be used to add identifier information for organisational units.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the latter, it is a subclass of prov:Agent, which through which it can map to the RDA recommendations on attribution (http://dx.doi.org/10.15497/RDA00029). The definition is appropriated from the Schema.org class.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PersonRole,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/PersonRole,Person Role,,,,,,,,,,A qualified association between a Person or OrganisationalUnit and an entity such as an ObjectGroup or MeasurementOrFact that enables the relationship to be contextualised with a specific role and time period.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is aligned with the prov:qualifiedAttribution property (http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#qualifiedAttribution). It should be used instead of the Activity and PersonActivity classes to link a Person or OrganisationalUnit to an entity in situations where an activity is not know or is irrelevant, for example for describing a person's role within an organisation. It is not mandatory to link to either a Person or a Role in this class, to support use cases where a role is known but the person who fulfilled it is not, and where a person is known to have been involved but the context is not.

In the context of Latimer Core, the main purposes of this class are 1. to define different semantic and hierarchical relationships between ObjectGroups, and 2. to support quantified and annotated relationships between ObjectGroups and other LtC classes (such as ltc:Taxon and ltc:GeographicContext) and properties (such as ltc:discipline and ltc:objectType) that describe the contents of the ObjectGroup, using the hasMeasurementOrFact property.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
