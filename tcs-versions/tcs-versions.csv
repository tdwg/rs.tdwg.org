A Taxon Concept is identifiable, because it combines a label – `taxonName` in TCS – with a source – `accordingTo`. Both the `taxonName` and `accordingTo` properties are REQUIRED on a `tcs:TaxonConcept`. When mentioning a taxon concept, the label and the source are combined, separated by 'sec.' (from, 'secundus', meaning 'according to') or 'sensu' (meaning the same). The term `dcterms:title` has been borrowed from Dublin Core to provide this taxon concept label. Because of the context provided by the source, taxon concepts are in principle also alignable to other Taxon Concepts using TCS concept mapping statements. The concept mapping properties in TCS are `isCongruentWith`, `includes`, `isIncludedIn`, `partiallyOverlaps`, `isDisjointFrom` and `intersects`. These properties can be used directly on a `TaxonConcept` object or as the value of the `tcs:mappingRelation` property in a `tcs:TaxonConceptMapping` object.¶The TCS Taxon Concept is applied more broadly than the term is used in science (e.g. Franz & Peet 2009 [\[franz_perspectives_2009\]](../bibliography/#franz_perspectives_2009)). On the one hand, things that are not generally considered to be biological taxa, e.g. hybrids and cultivars, can be casted as TCS Taxon Concepts. Also Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) [\[sokal_principles_1963\]](../bibliography/#sokal_principles_1963) can be exchanged as Taxon Concepts, if there is a reason to do so, e.g. if one wants to align them with other Taxon Concepts later. On the other hand, entries from treatments that are considered to cite concepts from other treatments can be formulated as Taxon Concepts. Every taxon concept from a treatment that is likely to be referenced as the source of taxonomic context, for example a field guide for a determination of a specimen or a national census for an ecological study, can – and it would be very nice if they would – be stated as a Taxon Concept, so they can be aligned with other Taxon Concepts that may provide more or different taxonomic context.¶By contrast, entries in the nomenclature section of treatments ('TaxonomicNameUsage's sensu Senderov et al. 2018 &#91;[senderov_openbiodiv-o_2018](#senderov_openbiodiv-o_2018)&#93;) and in lists of nomenclatural types are not Taxon Concepts.",https://tdwg.github.io/tcs2/examples/TaxonConcept-example-1.html | https://tdwg.github.io/tcs2/examples/TaxonConcept-example-2.html | https://tdwg.github.io/tcs2/examples/TaxonConcept-example-3.html | https://tdwg.github.io/tcs2/examples/TaxonConcept-example-4.html | https://tdwg.github.io/tcs2/examples/TaxonConcept-example-5.html | https://tdwg.github.io/tcs2/examples/TaxonConcept-example-6.html | https://tdwg.github.io/tcs2/examples/TaxonConcept-example-7.html,,http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class,http://rs.tdwg.org/tcs/terms/TaxonConcept,TaxonConcept

A Taxon Concept can have only one `accordingTo`.,"Every Taxon Concept is in some sort of treatment and this treatment provides important context without which we do not know what a taxon name really means and therefore the `accordingTo` property is REQUIRED for a TCS Taxon Concept. In TCS 2, `accordingTo` has to be a reference to some sort of resource rather than just a person's name. However, TCS is lenient about the nature of this resource and, apart from references to bibliographic resources, references to personal communications and determinations are also acceptable, if there is value in supplying taxon concepts from such communications as Taxon Concepts.¶The value of `accordingTo` has to be an object or IRI. This object can contain as little as a bibliographic reference but it is more useful to provide it in a format that can be understood by reference managers such as Zotero or Mendeley.",https://tdwg.github.io/tcs2/examples/TaxonConcept-accordingTo-example-1.html | https://tdwg.github.io/tcs2/examples/TaxonConcept-accordingTo-example-2.html | https://tdwg.github.io/tcs2/examples/TaxonConcept-accordingTo-example-3.html,,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/tcs/terms/TaxonConcept,accordingTo

In TCS, combinations are dealt with using properties of the `TaxonName` class, _e.g._, `basionym` and `replacedName` (note that 'combination' is used here in a broader sense than what the term actually means). This has the advantage that people do not need to separate heterotypic and homotypic synonyms, or generally deal with nomenclature, which adds a degree of complexity that not all systems need or want. Avoiding terms that are strictly defined in the nomenclatural codes also has the advantage that the term can, in principle, be applied to things that cannot be heterotypic or homotypic synonyms, e.g., to names that are not validly published under the relevant code, and avoids inappropriate use of the terms defined in the nomenclatural codes.",https://tdwg.github.io/tcs2/examples/TaxonConcept-synonym-example-1.html | https://tdwg.github.io/tcs2/examples/TaxonConcept-synonym-example-2.html | https://tdwg.github.io/tcs2/examples/TaxonConcept-synonym-example-3.html,,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/tcs/terms/TaxonConcept,synonym
