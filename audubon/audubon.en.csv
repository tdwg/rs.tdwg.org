Nothing in this document would, however, prevent an implementer, e. g. of an XML-Schema representation, from providing a fully hierarchical schema in which language neutral terms occur only a single time, and only the language-specific terms are repeated in a way that unambigously relates them to a metadata language.

taxonCount:dcterms_description,Description for Taxon Count http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/taxonCount,"Primarily intended for resource collections and singular resources dealing with sets of taxa (e. g., identification tools, videos). It is recommended to give an exact or estimated number of specific taxa when a complete list of taxa is not available or practical. For a taxon page and most images this will be ""1"", i. e. other taxa mentioned on the side or in the background should not be counted. However, sometimes a resource may illustrate an ecological or behavioral entity with multiple species, e. g., a host-pathogen interaction; taxon count would then indicate the known number of species in this interaction. Leave the field empty if you cannot estimate the information (do not enter 0). Additional taxon counts at higher levels (e. g. how many families are covered by a digital Fauna) should be given verbatim in the resource description, not here."

taxonCoverage:dcterms_description,Description for Taxon Coverage http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/taxonCoverage,"Example: Where the subject of an image is several species of ducks with trees visible in the background, Taxon Coverage would still be Anatidae (and not Biota). Example: ""Aves"" for a bird key or a bird image collection. Do not add a rank (""Class Aves"") in this field. Note that this somewhat expands the usage of ncd:taxonCoverage which, however has not yet been adopted by TDWG, and which specifies at the Family level or higher. For collections it is recommended to follow ncd:taxonCoverage to avoid conflicts between an AC record and a record arising from use of the un-adopted NCD. If the resource contains a single taxon, this should be placed in Scientific Taxon Name. In this case Taxon Coverage may be left empty, but if not, care should be taken that the entries do not conflict. Example: If Scientific Taxon Name is Quercus alba then Taxon Coverage, if provided at all, should be Quercus."

This makes datetime records compliant with 8601:2004, https://www.iso.org/standard/40874.html. AC datetime values MAY also follow 8601:2004 for ranges by separating two IS0 8601 datetime fields by a solidus (""forward slash"", '/')."

If a value is from the Audiovisual Core Content Description controlled vocabulary, it is not necessary to provide a value for ac:subjectCategoryVocabulary. Multiple values MAY be provided and separated by space vertical bar space ( | ), however they MUST be from a single vocabulary. It is best practice to use Iptc4xmpExt:CVterm instead of ac:CVtermLiteral whenever practical."
