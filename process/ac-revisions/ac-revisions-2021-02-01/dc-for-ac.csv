format,Format (literal),"The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource.","A controlled value string describing the technical format of the resource (file format or physical medium). The string SHOULD be a controlled value from the the Audubon Core Controlled Vocabulary for Dublin Core format, although it MAY be any Media Type (MIME type) value from the IANA list of Media Types (https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) or any commonly used file extension string. Human-readable information about the Controlled Vocabulary for format is at http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/doc/format/ .","This term can be used to describe offline digital content. In cases where the provided Service Access Point URL includes a standard file extension from which the format can be inferred, it is permissible to not provide a value for this property. See also the entry for dcterms:format in the Audubon Core term list document and see the DCMI FAQ on DC and DCTERMS Namespaces, https://web.archive.org/web/20171126043657/https://github.com/dcmi/repository/blob/master/mediawiki_wiki/FAQ/DC_and_DCTERMS_Namespaces.md, for discussion of the rationale for terms in two namespaces. It is best practice to use dcterms:format instead of dc:format whenever practical. Normal practice is to use the same Label if both are provided. Labels have no effect on information discovery and are only suggestions.",,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/terms/ServiceAccessPoint,,,No,No
