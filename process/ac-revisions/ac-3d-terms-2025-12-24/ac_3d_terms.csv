ac:numberOfImages,Number of Images,Dimensions: The number of images or z-axis pixels that provide information on a 3D scene,"Additional usage notes for “numberOfImages”: This term shall be used to specify the number of files or slices in a projection series (CT), reconstructed image series (CT, MRI), or that were collected in a photogrammetry session. In cases where volume raster data is represented as a single file (Nifti, NRRD, 3D tiff, dicom Multi-files) it should be used to give the number of Z axis pixels. Other possible uses include any case where each file in a collection represents a part or a view of a single or multiple focal objects that together can be used to understand the 3D nature of the focal object(s). For instance, raw data from laser scans and structured light scans often include a number of partial meshes that represent different parts of the scanned object which need to be processed through alignment and merging before rendering as a full 3D object.
