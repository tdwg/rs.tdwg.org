CVterm,Subject Category,A term to describe the content of the image by a value from a Controlled Vocabulary. ,"Controlled vocabulary of subjects to support broad classification of media items. Terms from various controlled vocabularies may be used. AC-recommended vocabularies are preferred and MAY be unqualified literals (not a full URI). For terms from other vocabularies either a precise URI SHOULD be used, or, as long as all unqualified terms in all vocabularies are unique, metadata SHOULD provide the source vocabularies using the Subject Category Vocabulary term. The value SHOULD be a string, whose text can also be in the form of a URL.  These guidelines on value format are less restrictive than is specified by the IPTC guidelines.","Recommended sets include: the NASA Global Change Master Directory (GCMD; http://gcmd.nasa.gov/), Subject Categories defined in Key to Nature (K2N; http://www.keytonature.eu/wiki/Subject_Category), the BioComplexity Thesaurus; https://www2.usgs.gov/core_science_systems/csas/biocomplexity_thesaurus/, the Description Type GBIF Vocabulary; http://rs.gbif.org/vocabulary/gbif/description_type.xml, the TDWG Species Profile Model; http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems.rdf, the Plinian Core; https://github.com/tdwg/PlinianCore/wiki, the European Environmental Agency GEneral Multilingual Environmental Thesaurus (GEMET; http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet), and the Long Term Ecological Research Network Controlled Vocabulary (LTER; http://vocab.lternet.edu/). The vocabulary may include major taxonomic groups (such as ""vertebrates"" or ""fungi"") or ecosystem terms (""savannah"", ""temperate rain forest"", ""forest fires"", ""aquatic vertebrates""). Other formal classifications (published in print or online) such as habitat, fuel, invasive species, agroproductivity, fisheries, migratory species etc. are also suitable.",http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/ContentCoverage,,,No,Yes
LocationCreated,Location Created,The location the content of the item was created ,The location at which the media recording instrument was placed when the media was created.,"The distinction between the location shown and created is often irrelevant, and metadata may be assumed to be referring to location shown. It is recommended that the Location Shown field above always be used when known. However, in the case of position data automatically recorded by the instrument (e. g. EXIF GPS data) Location Created should be used to maintain information accuracy. When one but not both of these locations are present, AC is silent about whether the provided one entails the other. A best practices document for a particular AC implementation might address this.",http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/ResourceCreation,,,No,Yes
LocationShown,Location Shown,A location the content of the item is about.

This element is at the first (topI) level of a topdown geographical hierarchy.,"Name of a world region in some high level classification, such as names for continents, waterbodies, or island groups, whichever is most appropriate. The terms preferably are derived from a controlled vocabulary.","The equivalent DarwinCore fields here forces primary metadata providers to classify world region terms into separate properties for ""continent"", ""waterbody"", ""islandGroup"". By contrast, the Iptc4xmpExt vocabulary only specifies that a World Region is something at the top of a hierarchy of locations.",http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://purl.org/dc/terms/Location,,,No,Yes
