taxonCount,Taxon Count,An exact or estimated number of taxa at the lowest applicable taxon rank (usually species or infraspecific) represented by the media resource (item or collection).,The count SHOULD contain only the taxa covered fully or primarily by the resource. This SHOULD be a single integer number. ,"Primarily intended for resource collections and singular resources dealing with sets of taxa (e. g., identification tools, videos). It is recommended to give an exact or estimated number of specific taxa when a complete list of taxa is not available or practical. For a taxon page and most images this will be ""1"", i. e. other taxa mentioned on the side or in the background should not be counted. However, sometimes a resource may illustrate an ecological or behavioral entity with multiple species, e. g., a host-pathogen interaction; taxon count would then indicate the known number of species in this interaction. Leave the field empty if you cannot estimate the information (do not enter 0). Additional taxon counts at higher levels (e. g. how many families are covered by a digital Fauna) should be given verbatim in the resource description, not here.",http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/TaxonomicCoverage,,,No,No
taxonCoverage,Taxon Coverage,"A higher taxon (e. g., a genus, family, or order) at the level of the genus or higher, that covers all taxa that are the primary subject of the resource (which may be a media item or a collection).",,"Example: Where the subject of an image is several species of ducks with trees visible in the background, Taxon Coverage would still be Anatidae (and not Biota). Example: ""Aves"" for a bird key or a bird image collection. Do not add a rank (""Class Aves"") in this field. Note that this somewhat expands the usage of ncd:taxonCoverage which, however has not yet been adopted by TDWG, and which specifies at the Family level or higher. For collections it is recommended to follow ncd:taxonCoverage to avoid conflicts between an AC record and a record arising from use of the un-adopted NCD. If the resource contains a single taxon, this should be placed in Scientific Taxon Name. In this case Taxon Coverage may be left empty, but if not, care should be taken that the entries do not conflict. Example: If Scientific Taxon Name is Quercus alba then Taxon Coverage, if provided at all, should be Quercus.",http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/TaxonomicCoverage,,,No,No

variantLiteral,Variant,Text that describes this Service Access Point variant.,,"This is an alternative to ac:variant where using a string is preferred over a URI. It is best practice to use ac:variant instead of ac:variantLiteral wherever practical. Value may be free text, but it is suggested to consider including terminology based on the following: Thumbnail: Service Access Point provides a thumbnail image, short sound clip, or short movie clip that can be used in addition to the resource to represent the media object, typically at lower quality and higher compression than a preview object. A typical size for a tiny thumbnail image may be 50-100 pixels in the longer dimension. Trailer: Service Access Point provides video clip preview, in the form of a specifically authored ""Trailer"", which may provide somewhat different content than the original resource. Lower Quality: Service Access Point provides a lower quality version of the media resource, suitable e. g. for web sites. Medium Quality: Service Access Point provides a medium quality version of the media resource, e. g. shortened in duration, or reduced size, using lower resolution or higher compression causing moderate artifacts. Good Quality: Service Access Point provides a good quality version of the media resource intended for resources displayed as primary information; e. g. an image between 800 and 1600 px in width or height. Best Quality: Service Access Point provides the highest available quality of the media resource, whatever its resolution or quality level. Offline: Service Access Point provides data about an offline resource.",http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/terms/ServiceAccessPoint,,,No,Yes
