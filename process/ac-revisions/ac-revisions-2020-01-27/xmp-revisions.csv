CreateDate,Original Date and Time,"The date and time the resource was created. For a digital file, this need not match a file-system creation time.  For a freshly created resource, it should be close to that time, modulo the time taken to write the file.  Later file transfer, copying, and so on, can make the file-system time arbitrarily different.","The date of the creation of the original resource from which the digital media was derived or created. The date and time MUST comply with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) datetime practice, https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime, which requires that date and time representation correspond to ISO 8601:1998, but with year fields always comprising 4 digits. This makes datetime records compliant with 8601:2004, https://www.iso.org/standard/40874.html. AC datetime values MAY also follow 8601:2004 for ranges by separating two IS0 8601 datetime fields by a solidus (""forward slash"", '/').","What constitutes ""original"" is determined by the metadata author. Example: Digitization of a photographic slide of a map would normally give the date at which the map was created; however a photographic work of art including the same map as its content may give the date of the original photographic exposure. Imprecise or unknown dates can be represented as ISO dates or ranges. Compare also Date and Time Digitized in the Resource Creation Vocabulary. See also the wikipedia IS0 8601 entry, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601, for further explanation and examples.",http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://purl.org/dc/terms/PeriodOfTime,,,No,No
MetadataDate,Metadata Date,The date and time that any metadata for this resource was last changed. It should be the same as or more recent than xmp:ModifyDate.,"Point in time recording when the last modification to metadata (not necessarily the media object itself) occurred. The date and time MUST comply with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) datetime practice, https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime, which requires that date and time representation correspond to ISO 8601:1998, but with year fields always comprising 4 digits. This makes datetime records compliant with 8601:2004, https://www.iso.org/standard/40874.html. AC datetime values MAY also follow 8601:2004 for ranges by separating two IS0 8601 datetime fields by a solidus (""forward slash"", '/').","This is not dcterms:modified, which refers to the resource itself rather than its metadata.

Rating,Rating,"A user-assigned rating for this file. The value shall be -1 or in the range [0..5], where -1 indicates ""rejected"" and 0 indicates ""unrated"".  If xmp:Rating is not present, a value of 0 should be assumed.","A rating of the media resources, provided by record originators or editors, with '1' (worst) to '5' (best). Anticipated usage is for a typical 'star rating' UI, with the addition of a notion of rejection. Values MAY be decimal numbers in the permitted range.","The origin of the rating is not communicated. It may, e. g., be based on user feedback or on editorial ratings. By ""user-assigned"" is meant assigned by the originator or editor of the record using the term.",http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/Management,,,No,No
