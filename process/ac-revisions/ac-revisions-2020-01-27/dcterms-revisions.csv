description,Description,An account of the resource. ,"Description of collection or individual resource, containing the Who, What, When, Where and Why as free-form text.","This property optionally allows the presentation of detailed information and will in most cases be shown together with the resource title. If both a description and a caption are present in the metadata, a description is typically displayed instead of the resource, whereas a caption is displayed together with the resource. The description should aim to be a good proxy for the underlying media resource in cases where only text can be shown, whereas the caption may only make sense when shown together with the media. Often only one of description or caption is present; choose the term most appropriate for your metadata.

source,Published Source,A related resource from which the described resource is derived. ,URI for an identifiable source from which the described resources was derived.,"If the resource was digitized from a non-digital resource, or was also previously published in a digital or printed publication, this describes the original.

A URI that can be resolved and dereferenced to provide a description of the source resource may also be used here. For example, ""http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/fsa1998021539/PP/"" is the address of a web page that provides a description the original negative of a famous picture by the photographer Dorothea Lange and so would be an appropriate value of dcterms:source.

temporal,Temporal Coverage,Temporal characteristics of the resource. ,"The coverage (extent or scope) of the content of the resource. Temporal coverage will typically include temporal period (a period label, date, or date range) to which the subjects of the media or media collection relate.

title,Title,A name given to the resource.,"Concise title, name, or brief descriptive label of institution, resource collection, or individual resource. This field SHOULD include the complete title with all the subtitles, if any.","It is strongly suggested to provide a title. The title facilitates interactions with humans: e.g., it could be used as display text of hyperlinks or to provide a choice of images in a pick list. The title is therefore highly useful and an effort should be made to provide it where it is not already available. When the resource is a collection without an institutional or official name, but with a thematic content, a descriptive title, e. g. ""Urban Ants of New England,"" would be suitable. In individual media resources depicting taxa, the scientific name or names of taxa often form a good title. Common names in addition to or instead of scientific names are also acceptable. Indications of action or roles captured by the media resource, such as predatory acts, are desirable (""Rattlesnake eating deer mouse"", ""Pollinators of California Native Plants"").",http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/Management,,,No,No
