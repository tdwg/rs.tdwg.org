format,Format,"The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource.",A string describing the technical format of the resource (file format or physical medium).,"Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the list of Internet Media Types [MIME]. This term is recommended for offline digital content. In cases where the provided URL includes a standard file extension from which the format can be inferred, it is permissible to not provide this item. Three types of values are recommended: (a) any MIME type; (b) common file extensions like txt, doc, odf, jpg/jpeg, png, pdf; (c) the following special values: Data-CD, Audio-CD, Video-CD, Data-DVD, Audio-DVD, Video-DVD-PAL, Video-DVD-NTSC, photographic slide, photographic print. Compare Type for the content-type.

language,Language,A language of the resource.,Language(s) of resource itself represented in the ISO639-2 three-letter language code. ISO639-1 two-letter codes are permitted but deprecated.,"An image may contain language such as superimposed labels. If an image is of a natural scene or organism, without any language included, the resource is language-neutral (ISO code ""zxx""). Resources with present but unknown language are to be coded as undetermined (ISO code ""und""). Regional dialects or other special cases should conform to the ISO639-5 Alpha-3 Code for Language Families and Groups, http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-5.html, where possible or the IETF Best Practices for Tags Identifying Languages, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646, where not.

rights,Copyright Statement,Information about rights held in and over the resource.,"A full-text, readable copyright statement, as required by the national legislation of the copyright holder. On collections, this applies to all contained objects, unless the object itself has a different statement. Do not place just the name of the copyright holder(s) here! That belongs in a list in the xmpRights:Owner field, which SHOULD be supplied if dc:rights is not 'Public Domain', which is appropriate only if the resource is known to be not under copyright. At least one of dcterms:rights and dc:rights MUST be supplied but, when feasible, supplying both might make the metadata more widely useful. They MUST specify the same rights. ","This expresses rights over the media resource, not over the metadata text. In case of ambiguity, dcterms:rights prevails. See also the entry for dcterms:rights in the Audubon Core Term List document and see the DCMI FAQ on DC and DCTERMS Namespaces, https://web.archive.org/web/20171126043657/https://github.com/dcmi/repository/blob/master/mediawiki_wiki/FAQ/DC_and_DCTERMS_Namespaces.md, for discussion of the rationale for terms in two namespaces.

source,Published Source,A related resource from which the described resource is derived. ,A string providing an identifiable source from which the described resources was derived.,"If the resource was digitized from a non-digital resource, or was also previously published in a digital or printed publication, this describes the original. Do not put generally ""related"" publications in here. This field normally contains a free-form text description. If a URI is available it should be provided in dcterms:source. Can be repeatable if a montage of images. Information about further provenance beyond the ultimate source should be put in the derivedFrom attribute.

type,Type,The nature or genre of the resource.,"The value of dc:type SHOULD be a term name of any term from the DCMI Type Vocabulary, https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#section-7 RECOMMENDED term names for media items are ""Collection"", ""StillImage"", ""Sound"", ""MovingImage"", ""InteractiveResource"", and ""Text"". A Collection MUST be given a value of ""Collection"". Following the DC recommendations at http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text, images of text SHOULD be given a value of ""Text"" for dc:type. A value for at least one of dc:type and dcterms:type MUST be supplied in an Audubon Core record but when feasible, supplying both can make the metadata more widely useful. The values of dc:type and dcterms:type SHOULD designate the same type, but in case of ambiguity dcterms:type prevails.","If the resource is a Collection, this term does not identify what types of objects it may contain.
