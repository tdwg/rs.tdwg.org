# If the document being generated is a list of terms document, these values will be
# set automatically when the process.py script is used to generate the machine-readable
# metadata for the vocabulary. They should not be set manually because they will just be
# overwritten.

# However, for non-list of terms documents, these values
# must be set manually here.

# versionDate is REQUIRED. The date of ratification. For List of Terms documents, this date SHOULD 
# match the version date for the corresponding vocabulary version.
versionDate: '2025-06-12'

# utcOffset is RECOMMENDED. The offset from UTC time in the form `+hh:mm` or `-hh:mm` 
# (e.g. `-06:00` for Central (US) Standard Time). This value is added to the date returned by the 
# Python `datetime.datetime.now()` function to generate the modification date fields. Omitting it will make 
# the modification date ambiguous.
utcOffset: -05:00

# docIri is REQUIRED. This is the permanent current IRI assigned to the document following the IRI patterns 
# established at http://rs.tdwg.org/index#2-iri-patterns. If this IRI does not match any existing document IRI 
# in the documents metadata, the script treats the document as new, so if the document is a new version of an 
# existing document, it's very important to get this IRI exactly right. The convention is that these documents 
# have trailing slashes
docIri: http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/doc/pw/
