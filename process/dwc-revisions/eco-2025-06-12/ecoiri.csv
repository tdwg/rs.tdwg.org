samplingEffortProtocol,Sampling Effort Protocol (IRI),"A method or protocol used to determine the sampling effort, denoted by an IRI.","This protocol should be associated with the values reported in eco:samplingEffortValue and eco:samplingEffortUnit. This is a specialization of eco:protocolDescriptions focused on effort, distinct from the survey method. The effort relates to the intensity of sampling and therefore can assist in interpreting estimates of completeness. Terms in the dwciri namespace are intended to be used in RDF with non-literal objects.",,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,not in ABCD,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Event,,
