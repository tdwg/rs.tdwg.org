samplingEffortProtocol,Sampling Effort Protocol,A description of or reference (publication or URL) to the methods used to determine the sampling effort.,"This description should be associated with the values reported in eco:samplingEffortValue and eco:samplingEffortUnit. This is a specialization of eco:protocolDescriptions focused on effort, distinct from the survey method. The effort relates to the intensity of sampling and therefore can assist in interpreting estimates of completeness. This term has an equivalent in the dwciri: namespace that allows only an IRI as a value, whereas this term allows for any string literal value.","`40 box traps deployed at even spacings along 4 parallel 100m transects placed 50m apart and visited at 6 hourly intervals over a 48 hour period`; `2 people occupying a bird hide for a period of 8 hours and undertaking a 30 minute count of species within the 150 degree field of view every 2 hours`; `A single baited camera trap station with motion sensor trigger, deployed for a period of 10 days and configured for detecting large fauna moving through a known traffic way`",http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,not in ABCD,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Event,,extension
areNonTargetTaxaFullyReported,Are Non-target Taxa Fully Reported,"Every dwc:Organism that was outside of the target taxonomic scope (the combination of eco:targetTaxonomicScope and eco:excludedTaxonomicScope) and detected during the dwc:Event, and that was detectable using the given protocol (given in eco:protocolDescriptions and dwc:samplingProtocol), was reported.","This term is meant to inform a user of the data whether there were non-target taxa that were detected, but left unreported. This term is only relevant if the dwc:Event used restricted search or open search methods and if a target taxonomic scope is declared. Taxonomic scope is based on the combination of eco:targetTaxonomicScope and eco:excludedTaxonomicScope. Within dwc:Events that used either a restricted search or an open search method and declared a taxonomic scope, if all dwc:Organisms that are not included within the target taxonomic scope and that were detected during the dwc:Event were reported, the value of this term should be 'true', otherwise the value of this term should be ‘false'.",`true`; `false`,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,not in ABCD,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Event,,extension
samplingPerformedBy,Sampling Performed By,"A person, group, or organization responsible for recording the dwc:Event.","The sampling dwc:Event could be at any level of hierarchy. In the case of a higher level (parent) dwc:Event, include all the organizations or people involved in the child dwc:Events that contributed to the parent dwc:Event. Recommended best practice is to separate multiple values in a list with space vertical bar space ( | ).
