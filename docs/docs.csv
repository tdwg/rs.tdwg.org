It is aimed at both decision makers and implementers of systems and so the content varies from being of a general nature, assuming little prior knowledge of taxonomy or XML technologies, to being quite detailed concerning the technicalities of biological nomenclature and XML schemas. Generally it becomes more specific as it goes on. This document is not a step by step manual for mapping a data source to a TCS document. Each data source is likely to be different in structure and so this is not a feasible exercise. What it attempts to do is provided the information needed for an implementer to make intelligent decisions as to how their data source should be mapped to the schema so that they can publish and/or receive data from other systems with as little confusion as possible.

This vocabulary is employed along with the Darwin Core (DwC) terms, effectively broadening the scope of dwc:Event records by incorporating terms absent from the main DwC vocabulary. Terms included in the extension are defined such that they can accommodate hierarchical data structures allowing the representation of complex, highly nested survey designs, permitting the computation of relative abundances of species. This document lists all terms currently used in the vocabulary providing comments and examples of their usage along with ancillary documents that provide guidance on the use and interpretation of terms and the data structure needed to accommodate dwc:Event hierarchies frequently observed in ecological inventories."

A Latimer Core record may represent a grouping of objects at any level of granularity above the level of a single object, from an entire collection of an institution to a few objects in a single drawer. The classes within the standard aim to allow the high-level representation of any given collection by providing a framework within which the defining characteristics shared by objects in the collection can be described. Among others, these include their taxonomic, geographic, stratigraphic and temporal coverage, and a framework for adding quantative metrics and narratives to help to quantify and describe the collections."
