This term includes resources composed of one or more files that are used to compute a 3D geometry (e.g., X-ray projections for computed tomography scans or photograph sets for photogrammetry). For avoidance of doubt, 2D renderings (views) produced from a Digital3DResource should not be included in this class, but stereo image pairs, anaglyphs, and other formats that hold information about 3D geometry may be included.",,http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/Digital3DResource,,,No,,Digital3DResource

This makes datetime records compliant with 8601:2004, https://www.iso.org/standard/40874.html.
